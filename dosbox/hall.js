// The public lobby: one room of the lobby server, WC-LOBBY, where pilots who
// do not know each other yet say which room they fly in.
//
// It is an ordinary lobbylink room of 32 seats (or as many as the server
// gives a room: it says so, and the page asks again for that many), and its
// chat goes from browser to browser like a game's messages do; the lobby
// server only introduces the browsers to each other.  There is nobody in
// charge of it, so every page keeps the rules itself, for what its own
// player types and for what arrives (web/chatfilter.js): lines of 60
// characters, two to start with and then one every ten seconds (one a
// second while fewer than eight pilots are there), no profanity, no links.
// A room code in a line (WC1-4821) is shown as a link that joins that room;
// the page decides whether the game fits (web/wc.js).  Nobody has to type a
// code: "Advertise" sends the pilot's room, its mission and its free seats,
// and "/room" in a line is the room's code.
//
// A pilot whose page has a game to fly is in the lobby (unless a link to a
// room brought it, or it left the lobby on an earlier visit), and out of it
// while it flies.  A page without a game does not connect at all: the lobby
// server and the pilots in the lobby hear only of visitors who brought the
// game (opts.ready; web/wc.js says what counts).
//
// The connection is this file's own and not the lobbylink client's
// (p2p-client.js), which serves a game: a room of strangers wants other
// habits.
//   * Browsers connect directly, and through the server's TURN relay only
//     when that has failed: the relay has ports for a few dozen links, and
//     the games need them.
//   * A seat whose page went away without leaving (a closed laptop) stays
//     taken as far as the server knows.  The room is made so that a seat
//     silent for two and a half minutes may be claimed by a newcomer when
//     all are taken, and every page says something to the server twice a
//     minute so that its own is not.  (The server counts any message as a
//     sign of life; it has no ping, so it answers "unknown message type".)
//   * The room ends when the server says so (a day after it was made, or
//     five minutes after the last pilot left): the next page makes it again.
//   * There is a row of lobbies: WC-LOBBY, then WC-LOBBY0, WC-LOBBY1, ...
//     A page takes a seat in the first that has one (a free seat, or a
//     silent pilot's), so pilots gather in the first and spill into the
//     next only when it is full.  That is also what keeps one bad page
//     from being the end of it: whoever makes a room decides its size and
//     its rules, and a page that keeps none could make WC-LOBBY with one
//     seat, or fill it.  The others then land in the next.
//   * Every pilot is linked to every other, so a newcomer to a full lobby
//     gets hundreds of offers.  They are spread over a few seconds: the
//     server drops a socket that has more than a hundred messages waiting.
