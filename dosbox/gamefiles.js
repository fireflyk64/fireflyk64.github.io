// The game registry is the only game-specific knowledge here: a game is
// recognised by an executable, run by a DOS command, and flagged when the
// emulator's multiplayer hooks apply to it (the five programs of Wing
// Commander 1 and 2: src/cpu/wcnet_game.cpp).
// `tag` is the game's name in a room code (WC1-4821; web/chatfilter.js):
// everyone in a room runs the same program, and the code says which.
// `partOf`: a program that comes in another game's directory (The Secret
// Missions 2 in Wing Commander's, the two Special Operations in Wing
// Commander II's): the directory is recognised by the game's own executable
// and the page lets the player choose among the programs in it
// (programsIn).
// Optional: `campaign`, the missions the host can pick for everybody: the
// series as the game numbers them, each with a name and its missions (a
// count, or one note per mission), and how a picked mission reaches the game:
// the hooks' MIS / SERIES environment (Wing Commander), or `missionArgs`,
// arguments for the game's own command line (Wing Commander II's developer
// switches), with `hints` for the page's lines about it.  `saves`, the files the game keeps its saved games in (relative to
// the game directory; the page keeps a copy in the browser and offers them as
// a download), and `cycles`, the emulated CPU speed the game plays well at
// (DOSBox's default of 3000 is what Ctrl+F11 / Ctrl+F12 adjust; Wing
// Commander 1 has no frame limiter, so its cutscenes and menus take their
// speed from this, while in flight the hooks hold 20 frames a second with
// 16000 cycles: WCFPS and WCFLIGHTCYCLES in the environment), and `pointer`,
// for a controller's stick (web/gamepad.js): where the mouse pointer rests
// when the game steers by it and how far it reaches, as fractions of the
// mouse range.  Both games park the pointer in the middle of the cockpit's
// window, which is another rectangle in every ship (318,52 of 640x200 in
// Wing Commander's Hornet, 34 up in its Rapier) and in every turret, and
// turn in steps by its distance from there: `fromGame` asks the running
// game for both (web/wc.js, steeringPointer).  Fixed figures {x, y, rx, ry}
// are the other form, for a game the hooks know nothing about.
// `firstName`: the game's people use the pilot's first name, and the page
// asks for one.
// `dosbox`: what the game's own setup expects of the machine, as the text of
// a DOSBox configuration file.
// `build`: how the hooks tell the executable they know from another of the
// same name (kGames in src/cpu/wcnet_game.cpp, whose figures these are): a
// string at an offset of the program's data segment, the segment given in
// paragraphs from the start of the image.  The page asks the file the same
// question (knownBuild): only a pilot whose game the hooks will fly is let
// into the public lobby.

// Wing Commander's Vega campaign: series 1.. and mission 0.. within the
